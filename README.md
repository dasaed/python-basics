# python-basics
A repository with a few python-related things. 
My goal is to have a tutorial-ish sort of repo, where each folder explains what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.
It's nothing fancy, and many of the most basic things here are for tutorials I'll be doing along with my little brother. 
I'm trying to get him into a career in computer science, but also trying to keep certain things fresh in my mind, so don't be surprised if the contents of the repo are all over the place. 

## Current Topics (folders)
Each folder has its own readme, with more details about each of the elements inside of it.

1. *pipenv* - basic pipenv tutorial (the how to get started, creating a new virtual environment, etc...)

## TODO
Ignore the order here, it's just the list of topics I can think off that I'd like to cover off the top of my head
1. *basics* - the real basics (objects, variables, functions, basically what you'd need if you were starting from 0)
2. *pandas* - For more scientific computing and dealing with tables and excel-like things
3. *flask* - Useful library/tool for on the go REST APIs
4. *django* - Useful for web development (flask is also useful for this, but as fully packaged as django)
5. *Shell_Scripting* - Useful for automating things you ran locally on your computer
6. *data structures* - for more advance software design applications
